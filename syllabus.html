        <h3>approach</h3>

        <p>In this class we will explore the practice of digital and new media art. Together we will take up a practical examination of what is 'fundamental' to digital media practice: the ways in which images, data, sound and video are encoded, manipulated and distributed. This will involve working on projects and concepts together. Ways of making will be inter-informed by ways of seeing and ways of thinking about the computer as a medium of communication, documentation, resistance, and expression.
        </p>
        <p>This is primarily a practice-based class. We will be looking at work by other artists and reading texts from a variety of fields (media theory, art history, sociology) that relate to the media we work with. We will spend most of our time making and discussing projects.</p>

                <h4>
                    readings </h4>
                <p>
                    This class has no required textbooks and all of your required readings will be online. However, I recommend budgeting $60-70 for a couple of reference books for the technologies/tools you concentrate on this quarter. A lot of software is free, and the stuff that costs money usually has some kind of trial. You can get a raspberry pi for $35 + shipping, or a good arduino kit for ~$45. If you want more robust web hosting than people.ucsc.edu, there are a lot of options in the $5/mo. range.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are readings (and occasionally viewings/listenings) assigned for each week. These are intended to provide historical and aesthetic context and a theoretical vocabulary for understanding artworks viewed in class as well as your own.

        <h3>
            responsibilities </h3>
        <h4>evaluation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>seven assignments: 10% x 7 = 70%</li>
            <li>final project: 15% (project, presentation, and documentation)</li>
            <li>participation: 15% (critiques, discussions, &amp;c.) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will automatically receive a failing grade for the class if one of the following apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a) You are absent from three class meetings, OR</li>
            <li>
                b) You do not submit three weekly projects, OR</li>

            <li>c) You do not submit a final project.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            All assignments must be completed on time. Late submission of completed assignments will receive no credit. We will discuss student work in class. To be fair to those who have submitted their work on time, it will not be possible to give credit for work that is late without a legitimate excuse.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each project must also be documented. This can take several forms. Things to consider: "how this works" if it isn't apparent in the work; concepts, theories or other works that your project addresses or references, or was inspired by; issues that you had trouble with; tools or ideas you used; tools or ideas you tried but abandoned; what you could have accomplished with a team of highly trained code (or design or whatever) ninjas and an unlimited budget. Include images/screenshots when appropriate. A 'time lapse' of the project's development, sketches, or glitches and accidents it produced during making. Projects that lack documentation will not receive full credit. Feel free to work in 'analog media', but submit digitally; smartphone photos of sketches will suffice. The goal here is to communicate some of your process -- how the work came together (or didn't). Documentation doesn't need to be exhaustive.
        </p>
        <p>
            All code-based assignments should be linted and beautified before being turned in (unless of course you're doing something interesting, maybe obfuscatory code art, that these break). I prefer the <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/README.md">AirBNB style guide</a> (not an endorsement of the site or its service) for JavaScript but will accept any code that is reasonably legible.
        </p>
        <h4>general assignment guidelines</h4>
        <p>
            Assignment descriptions are intentionally vague. Feel free to interpret things broadly and bounce any ideas you aren't sure of off me and/or your colleagues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Plagiarism, appropriation and copyright: Turning in other people's work as your own is obviously off limits, however you may incorporate others' works into your own under the guidelines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">Fair Use</a>. If you do include others' works, cite them in your documentation along with justification for your appropriation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Collaboration on assignments (and the Final Project) is fine, even encouraged. However, each student needs to submit documentation separately.
        </p>
        <h3>weekly projects</h3>
        <p>
            Each week we will be working with a different conceptual methodology and/or technological approach. Projects will be due on Thursdays at 4pm. Web-based projects should be hosted on your <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/web/hosting/personal-pages-tutorial.html">people.ucsc.edu</a> account or on your own domain. Larger files should be shared via a cloud hosting service (google drive, dropbox), usb stick, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>
            final project </h3>
        <p>
            Students are responsible for submitting a final project at the end of the quarter in a digital medium of their choice. Expect an annoucement with details mid-quarter. Projects will be proposed in advance. See schedule.
        </p>

        <h3>accessibility</h3>
        <p>I encourage any student with particular needs or anyone seeking disability accommodations to contact the Disability Resource Center: 831-459-2089; drc@ucsc.edu; http://drc.ucsc.edu.</p>

        <h3>electronic devices policy</h3>
        <p>In-class uses of laptops and other devices for note taking or for in-class work and exercises is permitted. I reserve the right to prohibit use of devices if these privileges are abused. Using devices for anything except notetaking during talks, crits and discussions is prohibitied. During lab/work time, you may use headphones.</p>
        <h3>project grading rubric</h3>

        <h4>90-92 = A-; 93-95 = A; 96+ = A+ </h4>
        <p>Excellent. High level of creativity, technical proficiency, and effort.</p>

        <h4>80-82 = B-; 83-85 = B; 86-89 = B+ </h4>

        <p>Good. Ability to grasp ideas and use/mix tools in order to complete assignments. Ability to communicate with others.</p>

        <h4>70-74 = C; 75-79 = C+</h4>

        <p>Needs improvement. Ability to complete most assignments but limited drive to push conceptual or practical skills. </p>


        <h4>60-69 = D; 50-59 = F </h4>

        <p>No Pass/Unsatisfactory. Inability or unwillingness to complete assignments or participate in class.</p>

            <h3>DRC STATEMENT</h3>

            <p>UC Santa Cruz is committed to creating an academic environment that supports its diverse student body. If you are a student with a disability who requires accommodations to achieve equal access in this course, please submit your Accommodation Authorization Letter from the Disability Resource Center (DRC) to me privately during my office hours or by appointment, preferably within the first two weeks of the quarter. At this time, I would also like us to discuss ways we can ensure your full participation in the course. I encourage all students who may benefit from learning more about DRC services to contact DRC by phone at 831-459-2089 or by email at drc@ucsc.edu.
            </p>


            <h3>ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT POLICY</h3>

            <p>Academic misconduct includes but is not limited to cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, or facilitating academic dishonesty. Acts of academic misconduct during the course, including plagiarism, can and usually do result in failure of the course, at the sole discretion of the instructor of record. Your case will be reported to the College Provost as per the Academic Integrity guidelines found on the web at:</p>

            <h4>https://www.ue.ucsc.edu/academic_misconduct</h4>

            <p>Information on subject specific research guidelines is available at:</p>

            <h4>http://guides.library.ucsc.edu/</h4>



            <h3>DISTRIBUTION OF COURSE NOTES</h3>

            <p>Please note that selling, preparing, or distributing for any commercial purpose course lecture notes or video or audio recordings of any course is explicitly forbidden by campus policy, unless authorized by the University in advance—for instance, by the Disability Resource Center, which can assign students who need one a notetaker with a laptop or other recording device – and explicitly permitted by the course instructor in writing. (DRC notetaking accommodations should, and usually will, be announced to the instructor in advance in formal communication from the DRC.)</p>



            <h3>PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY</h3>



            <p>In this class, we abide by the UCSC Principles of Community, so please familiarize yourself with these important principles.</p>



            <h3>DIFFICULT MATERIAL</h3>


            <p>In Film and Digital Media courses you will often be assigned films or other material that could contain difficult ideas, uncomfortable language, or graphic depictions of sex or violence. You will be asked to treat these portrayals critically, to consider what is being expressed by the maker, or to examine the potential social impact, and to evaluate the works in a given context. Instructors are always happy to speak with you about your work, and might direct you to CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) at 831-459-2628 or the Disability Resource Center (drc@ucsc.edu or 831-459-2089) should you need additional support in order to do your best work.
            </p>





            <h3>TITLE IX</h3>


            <p>The university cherishes the free and open exchange of ideas and enlargement of knowledge. To maintain this freedom and openness requires objectivity, mutual trust, and confidence; it requires the absence of coercion, intimidation, or exploitation. The principal responsibility for maintaining these conditions must rest upon those members of the university community who exercise most authority and leadership: faculty, managers, and supervisors.</p>

            <p>The university has therefore instituted a number of measures designed to protect its community from sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual violence, and other related prohibited conduct. Information about the Title IX Office, the <a href="https://ucsc-gme-advocate.symplicity.com/public_report/index.php/pid452535?"> online reporting link </a> (Links to an external site), applicable campus resources, reporting responsibilities, the <a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000385/SHSV"> UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment </a> (Links to an external site), and the UC Santa Cruz Procedures for Reporting and Responding to Reports of Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment can be found at <a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu/">titleix.ucsc.edu.</a> </p>


            <p>The Title IX/Sexual Harassment Office is located at 105 Kerr Hall. In addition to the <a href="https://ucsc-gme-advocate.symplicity.com/public_report/index.php/pid452535?"> online reporting option </a> (Links to an external site), you can contact the Title IX Office by calling 831-459-2462.</p>
